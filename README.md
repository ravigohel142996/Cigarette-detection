# 🚭 Cigarette Violation Detection in Restricted Areas

> A real-time computer vision system that detects persons smoking in restricted/non-smoking zones using a dual-model YOLOv11 pipeline with ByteTrack multi-object tracking.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements an AI-powered surveillance system capable of:

- **Detecting persons** in a video feed using the YOLOv11s model pre-trained on the COCO dataset
- **Detecting cigarettes** using a custom-trained YOLOv11s model (`best.pt`) fine-tuned on a labelled cigarette dataset
- **Associating** cigarette detections with persons using a spatial containment algorithm
- **Tracking** each individual across frames using ByteTrack, assigning unique IDs
- **Flagging violations** — any person whose bounding box contains a cigarette detection is marked as a smoker in a restricted area

The system is designed to simulate a real-world restricted-area monitoring use case, where smoking violations can be logged, flagged, or escalated automatically.

## 🎯 Detection Logic

```
Video Frame
    │
    ├──► YOLOv11s (COCO)  ──► Person detections  [class 0]
    │                              │
    └──► YOLOv11s (Custom) ──► Cigarette detections [class 1]
                                   │
                     Spatial Containment Check
                     (Is cigarette inside person box?)
                                   │
              ┌────────────────────┴────────────────────┐
              │                                         │
         YES → Person flagged as SMOKER           NO → Safe Person
         (Red bounding box)                       (Green bounding box)
```

**Containment Algorithm:** Rather than using standard IoU (which gives near-zero values since a cigarette box is tiny compared to a person), the system computes what fraction of the cigarette's bounding box lies within the person's bounding box. If that fraction exceeds the threshold (`0.30`), the person is flagged as smoking.

## 🧠 Models Used

| Model | Purpose | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `yolo11s.pt` | Person detection (class 0) | COCO pretrained — auto-downloaded by Ultralytics |
| `best.pt` | Cigarette detection (class 1) | Custom trained on labelled cigarette dataset |

### ⬇️ Download Custom Model (`best.pt`)

The custom cigarette detection model is hosted on Google Drive due to file size:

**[📥 Download best.pt from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bVRSFUKuPyENUBAcZmGeOIHQh8gKLCn2/view?usp=sharing)**

Place the downloaded `best.pt` file in the root of the project directory before running inference.

---

## 🏗️ Complete Pipeline

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- Raw images collected containing cigarettes in various scenarios
- Annotations created using **CVAT** (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) in YOLO format
- Dataset cleaned: non-annotated images removed, verified bounding boxes
- Split: **80% training / 20% validation**
- Final structure exported as a YOLO-compatible dataset with `data.yaml`

### 2. Model Training
- Base model: `yolo11s.pt` (small variant, optimised for speed)
- Framework: **Ultralytics YOLOv11**
- Training performed on GPU with custom hyperparameters
- Output: `best.pt` — the best checkpoint based on validation mAP

### 3. Inference Pipeline (`Inference.py`)
- **Person model** runs `.track()` with ByteTrack enabled → persistent IDs across frames
- **Cigarette model** runs `.predict()` on the same frame
- Spatial containment check links cigarettes to persons
- Per-frame visualisation drawn using OpenCV:
  - 🟢 Green box → Safe person
  - 🔴 Red box → Smoking person
  - 🟠 Orange box → Cigarette
  - Live stats panel (top-right): Total Persons / Smoking / Safe / Violations
  - Fixed black banner (bottom 8%) → `SMOKER DETECTED` text appears in red only when a violation is active
- Output video saved as `.mp4`

## ⚙️ Requirements

**Python:** 3.8+

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### `requirements.txt`

```
ultralytics>=8.3.0
opencv-python>=4.8.0
